# data-scrapper-and-write-to-excel-file
An example of scrapping data and creating reports in excel files in no-time!

My main research interest of this project is to evaluate Java programm quality , when compared to an equivalent implementation on Python.
Key Points for this project was : number of code lines written, clarity of code (in terms of human reading), reusability, speed-efficiency and resources management (CPU and memory.

The project is quite easy to run: it was written in Netbeans but you can compile it however you want.
Dependencies :
Jsoup covered the need of fetching & manipulating data from a url
Apache POI was needed for creating and delivering an excel file. 
Bare in mind that as it is you can choose between two types of output : (up to excel 2003) .xls file or .xlsx (excel 2007)

The example is on a website of selling laptops as an example of how data for an upcoming laptop sale can be extracted and evaluated in order to make a decission.

Next step is to include regex and optimize the scrappe & adapt-to-target-url quality.
